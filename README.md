# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Start a local MQTT broker
mosquitto -v

# 3. In another terminal, run the simulator (creates fake fixtures)
npm run sim
# or specify broker and number of devices:
# node tools/sim.js mqtt://127.0.0.1:1883 3

# 4. In a third terminal, launch the KLSTR Logger app
npm run dev

# 5. In the app:
#    - Enter broker URL: mqtt://127.0.0.1:1883
